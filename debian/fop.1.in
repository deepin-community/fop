[NAME]
fop \- Command line wrapper for the java version of fop.

[DESCRIPTION]
Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by XSL
formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. It is a Java
application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting
pages to a specified output. Output formats currently supported include PDF,
PS, PCL, AFP, XML (area tree representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a
lesser extent, RTF and TXT. The primary output target is PDF.

[HYPHENATION]
fop can make use of external hyphenation rules that can be supplied in
the form of a \fBhyphenation jar\fR. You can find such a one at
\fIhttp://offo.sourceforge.net/\fR.

To actually use that, set the \fBFOP_HYPHENATION_PATH\fR environment variable
to the full path of this file, or use configuration files, see below.

[CONFIGURATION FILES]
fop reads two configuration files on startup: \fI/etc/fop.conf\fR and
\fI$HOME/.foprc\fR. These are plain shell script files where you can define
for instance the \fBFOP_HYPHENATION_PATH\fR variable.

Another way to extend is \fIconf.d/\fR files. Simply add a configuration file
into \fI/etc/fop.conf.d/my.conf\fR.

[JAVA-WRAPPERS NOTE]
This program is a shell script wrapper based on \fBjava-wrappers(7)\fR. You
therefore benefit from several features; please see the \fBjava-wrappers(7)\fR
manual page for more information about them.
